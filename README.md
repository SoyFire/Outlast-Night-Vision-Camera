# Outlast-Night-Vision-Camera
Outlast night vision camera recreation in vanilla minecraft with resource packs and data packs.

The Resource pack and the Data pack are inside of the zip file.

This doesn't work in multiplayer and it glitches with entities with the glowing effect.

This resource pack works from version 1.16 and higher and uses shaders to work.

What this does is that it applies the shader when there is an entity with the glowing effect on screen, so the datapack generates an invisible armor stand with glowing and when you have the camera on your main hand this armor stand teleports in front of you applying the effect, when you don't have the camera on your main hand the armor stand dies.
